# HTML-Parser
An HTML parser which utilizes a python script to parse through any HTML file and present only the local resources used by the website. The script is initialized by a small bash script which prompts the user the webpage to be parsed.

The bash script automates the process by allowing the user to simply copy a link and execute the program, needing no additional effort.

NOTE:
*The Python3 script can be used without the bash script, the bash script is simply a QOL thing.
*The bash script does not need to be named as is, although the python script does.
*Currently the program only goes through the following:
  -CSS
  -Javascript
  -Hyperlinks
  -Images
